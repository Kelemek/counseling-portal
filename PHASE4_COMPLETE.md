# Phase 4 Complete: Admin Dashboard âœ…

## What We Built

### ðŸ“‹ Forms Management System
**Location:** `/admin/forms`

**Features:**
- View all JotForm submissions in a clean table format
- Parse and display form field names properly (removes technical IDs)
- See submission status: Unassigned, Pending, Active, or Completed
- View detailed form responses with all parsed fields
- Assign forms to counselors with notes and due dates
- Track which counselor is handling each form

**Pages Created:**
- `/admin/forms` - List all submissions
- `/admin/forms/[id]` - View individual form details
- `/admin/forms/[id]/assign` - Assign form to counselor

### ðŸ‘¥ Counselor Management System
**Location:** `/admin/counselors`

**Features:**
- View all counselors with their profiles
- See counselor workload (active vs total assignments)
- Create new counselor accounts with full profiles
- Display counselor specializations and bios

**Pages Created:**
- `/admin/counselors` - List all counselors
- `/admin/counselors/new` - Create new counselor account

**Counselor Profile Fields:**
- Full Name
- Email (login credential)
- Password (can be changed by counselor)
- Phone Number
- Specialization
- Bio

### ðŸ”§ API Routes Created

1. **`/api/admin/assign-form`**
   - Creates form_assignments linking forms to counselors
   - Validates form and counselor exist
   - Prevents duplicate assignments
   - Records assignment metadata (notes, due date, assigned_by)

2. **`/api/admin/create-counselor`**
   - Creates Supabase auth user with counselor role
   - Creates user record in users table
   - Creates counselor_profile with details
   - Auto-confirms email for new counselors

## How It Works

### Assignment Workflow
1. Admin views intake forms at `/admin/forms`
2. Admin clicks "Assign" on an unassigned form
3. Admin selects a counselor from dropdown
4. Admin optionally adds notes and due date
5. System creates `form_assignment` record with status "pending"
6. Form now shows as assigned in the forms list
7. Counselor will see this form in their dashboard (Phase 5)

### Counselor Creation Workflow
1. Admin goes to `/admin/counselors/new`
2. Admin fills in account info (email, password)
3. Admin fills in profile info (name, phone, specialization, bio)
4. System creates auth user with `role: 'counselor'`
5. System creates user record in database
6. System creates counselor_profile with details
7. Counselor can now log in with their email/password
8. Counselor profile triggers `handle_new_user()` function via database trigger

## Database Tables Used

### Tables We're Writing To:
- `form_assignments` - Links forms to counselors
- `users` - Stores counselor user records
- `counselor_profiles` - Stores counselor details

### Tables We're Reading From:
- `jotform_submissions` - Form data from JotForm webhook
- `users` - List of counselors
- `form_assignments` - Assignment status and history

## Security Features

âœ… **Admin-only access** - All routes protected by middleware and server-side role checks
âœ… **Role validation** - API routes verify user is admin before processing
âœ… **Exists checks** - Verify forms and counselors exist before creating assignments
âœ… **Duplicate prevention** - Block multiple assignments to same form
âœ… **Auth user cleanup** - If profile creation fails, auth user is deleted

## UI/UX Highlights

- **Responsive design** - Works on mobile, tablet, desktop
- **Loading states** - Buttons show "Creating..." or "Assigning..." during API calls
- **Error handling** - Clear error messages displayed to user
- **Empty states** - Helpful messages when no data exists yet
- **Breadcrumb navigation** - Back buttons on all detail pages
- **Status badges** - Color-coded badges for assignment status
- **Clean field parsing** - Removes JotForm technical field names
- **Collapsible raw data** - Option to view full submission JSON
- **Workload indicators** - Shows active/total assignments per counselor

## What's Next: Phase 5

The Counselor Dashboard will allow counselors to:
- View only their assigned forms (filtered by counselor_id)
- Create counselee accounts for their assigned cases
- Update assignment status (pending â†’ active â†’ completed)
- Assign homework to counselees
- Access chat with counselees (Phase 7)

2. Go to "Intake Forms"
3. You should see any JotForm submissions
